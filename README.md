# 2019AzureAutomationUserSetup
Files from my presentation on Azure Automation.

These are example files used to setup users in Active Directory and Azure AD based on a CSV file and an Azure Autoamation Watcher Task.  

Use at your own risk, test it before you trust it and be sure to read all comments for spots that need environment specific updates.
